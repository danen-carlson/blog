= In with Hubpress, out with...

This is my experiment with Hubpress. I'm impressed with the simplicity thus far. So far it seems simple to use but not easy to customize. Since I have no interest spending playing with site (like wordpress). Prior to this I've used 
http://docpad.org, 
https://jekyllrb.com, 
https://wordpress.com with varying degrees of satisfaction. Ultimatly I'd rather not spend time messing with any blogging backend, so I may end up sticking with hubpress despite the departure from markdown to asciidoc.

==== Notes:
* it uses ASCIIDOC instead of markdown. 
* With this framework you can't edit the html after it has been processed.
** Editing done to HTML directly breaks after any other updates are done to any part of the site.
** This means all edits must be done using ASCIIDOC format. 
** [\++++++ (four pluses) before and after a text block allow for inserting html / scripts. 
** Works well enough for my needs but I'd prefer the ability to edit the html directly
* Easy to host (as long as github continues to support it)
* Difficult to personalize.

==== ToDo:
* See about hosting the cloudflare css locally
* Look into hosting images locally
** [line-through]#referencing images in the /images/file.png folder seems to break when viewing an article.#  
** This seems to only affect the logo (see local image below).
** Move cover photo to /images directory
