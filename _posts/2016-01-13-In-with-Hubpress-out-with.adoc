This is my experiment with Hubpress. I'm impressed with the simplicity thus far. Too soon to tell. At some point I may compare it with: +

==== Notes:
* it uses ASCIIDOC instead of markdown. 
* With this framework you can't edit the html after it has been processed.
** Editing done to HTML directly breaks after any other updates are done to any part of the site.
** This means all edits must be done using ASCIIDOC format. 
** [\++++++ (four pluses) before and after a text block allow for inserting html / scripts. 
** Works well enough for my needs but I'd prefer the ability to edit the html directly
* Easy to host (as long as github continues to support it)
* Difficult to personalize.
