= Queries in Google Sheets

Generally SQL like with a few exceptions: +

* Column Reference: when referencing columns use "Col1, Col2..." when using importrange on separate spreadsheets
** Use "A, B..." instead of "Col1, Col2..." for queries done on the same sheet.  
* Report queries (importrange) are breaking when I get too far past 10,000 records
** Check to see if normal queries hit the same limit
*** On the same sheet
*** On a separate sheet
*** See if limits exist in fusion tables
*** See if limits apply when queiries are performed on fusion tables and recorded in sheets
* Relative references are not kept
** If a column is deleted from the source sheet it does not carry over to the query sheet (obvious, but worth noting)
